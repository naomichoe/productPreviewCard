## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to set up flexbox and basic layout structures. It was not enough to say I am well-versed but it was a good start in learning it.

### Continued development

Still need to refine my skills with flexbox and adjusting margins in general. Also need further understanding on using @media queries for screen changes.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://webgrowth.co.uk/technical-seo-tip-use-css-swap-images-mobile-desktop-users/) - This helped me for replacing the desktop image for a mobile image. It was the simplest explanation and easiest solution. I saw many other ways but they were too confusing to do, such as srcset/sizes.
- [Resource 2](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This is an amazing source for using flexbox in a basic way. It is just a quick reminder of what each setting does and looks like.
